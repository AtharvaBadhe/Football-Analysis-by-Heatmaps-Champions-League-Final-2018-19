# Football-Analysis-by-Heatmaps-Champions-League-Final-2018-19
In this project, I analyzed Liverpool's passing patterns in the 2018/19 Champions League Final using data visualization. I mapped pass start/end points for the whole team and Salah specifically. The analysis used mplsoccer for pitch visualization and statsbombpy to extract match data.
